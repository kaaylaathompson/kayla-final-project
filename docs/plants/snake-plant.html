<p>Snake plants, also known as Sansevieria, are popular houseplants known for their striking foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Light- They can tolerate a wide range of light conditions, from low to bright indirect light. They will grow best in indirect sunlight, but they can also survive in low-light conditions. Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, as it can scorch their leaves.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Water- Snake plants prefer to dry out between waterings. Water them thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out almost completely before watering again. In most indoor environments, watering every 2-4 weeks should be sufficient. Err on the side of underwatering rather than overwatering, as they are more tolerant of dry soil than soggy soil.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Pot- Select a planter that is a little bit bigger than the plant you are purchasing. Look for a wide planter that will balance this top-heavy plant. You can choose a self-watering container, or a planter and saucer. Terra cotta clay pots are a good choice for sansevieria because they are naturally drying.</p>
